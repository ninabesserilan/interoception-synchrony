RSA pipline

1. The pipeline should read the pickle
2. Based on the new ibib statistics, for each condition and participant, it should exclude participant that their session <  1 sec
3. Based on the new ibib statistics, for each condition and participant, it should exclude participant that their long_ibis sum > ibis lenght
4. calculate RSA for valid dyads
5. Organize the data in RSA pairs, this structure: condition (toys/no toys) > validity (valid/invalid) > dyad id > subjec(infant/mom) > data/exclusion_reason
